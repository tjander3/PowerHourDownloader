# TODO

Since I am doing small incremental work on this project it would take too much time to create issues for inital code develpment. Instead I will just add some tasks to this file so I can keep up to date on what I am doing / need to do.

- [x] Create project, use cookiecutter
- [x] Make sure testing works
- [ ] Create outline of all classes from class-diagram.md
    - [x] classes
        - [ ] abstractions
        - [ ] inheritance
        - [ ] functions
        - [ ] variables
- [ ] Create outline of all classes from class-diagram.md for tests
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Start implementing the classes (come up with order to implement first)
