# TODO

Since I am doing small incremental work on this project it would take too much time to create issues for inital code develpment. Instead I will just add some tasks to this file so I can keep up to date on what I am doing / need to do.

- [ ] Create project, use cookiecutter
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Make sure testing works
- [ ] Create outline of all classes from class-diagram.md
- [ ] Start implementing the classes (come up with order to implement first)
