# TODO

Since I am doing small incremental work on this project it would take too much time to create issues for inital code develpment. Instead I will just add some tasks to this file so I can keep up to date on what I am doing / need to do.

    - [x] classes
        - [x] abstractions
        - [ ] inheritance
