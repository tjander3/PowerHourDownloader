# TODO

Since I am doing small incremental work on this project it would take too much time to create issues for inital code develpment. Instead I will just add some tasks to this file so I can keep up to date on what I am doing / need to do.

- [ ] Bring in my bashrc
- [ ] Create outline of all classes from class-diagram.md for tests
    - [] PowerHourRunner
    - [] PowerHour
    - [] PowerHourParser
    - [] MyTube60Parser
    - [] Location
    - [] TextVideoOverlay
    - [] Transition
    - [] TransitionVideo
    - [] TransitionImage
    - [] YoutubeVideo
    - [] VideoLink
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] .github ci/cd once tests framework is stood up
- [ ] Start adding tests for classes
- [ ] Start implementing the classes (come up with order to implement first)
